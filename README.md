# Heart_Disease_Classification


This project aims to predict heart disease in patients based on clinical parameters and medical data. By analyzing a dataset comprising various health metrics, we built a machine learning model achieving an accuracy rate of 88.5%. Early detection is crucial in mitigating heart disease risks, and our model contributes to improving diagnostic efficiency.

Key Features:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand underlying patterns and their impact on heart disease prediction.

Explored and compared the efficiency of three different machine learning models.

Employed hyperparameter tuning techniques, resulting in a 10% improvement in model accuracy.

Utilized Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebooks.
